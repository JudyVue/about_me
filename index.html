        <p id ="bio">I graduated from the University of Washington in 2009 with a degree in journalism. I used to work for KUOW and KIRO radio stations and have taught English in South Korea. I worked as a paralegal for the last two years, but realized I hated it and desparately want a career change. I do standup comedy and improv as my hobbies because I like making people laugh.</p>
